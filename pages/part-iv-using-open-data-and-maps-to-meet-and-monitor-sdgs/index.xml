      <description>End poverty in all its forms everywhere “Extreme poverty rates have fallen by more than half since 1990. While this is a remarkable achievement, one-in-five people in developing regions still live on less than $1.90 a day. Millions more make little more than this daily amount and are at risk of slipping back into extreme poverty.”
Poverty elimination projects to map low income (often slum) areas can support humanitarian and development programming.</description>

      <description>End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture “Our soils, freshwater, oceans, forests and biodiversity are being rapidly degraded. Climate change is putting even more pressure on the resources we depend on, increasing risks associated with disasters such as droughts and floods. Many rural women and men can no longer make ends meet on their land, forcing them to migrate to cities in search of opportunities.</description>

      <description>Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages “Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers responsible for child and maternal mortality. Major progress has also been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation, reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio and the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, many more efforts are needed to control a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and emerging health issues.</description>

      <description>Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning “Basic literacy skills across the world have improved tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to achieve universal education goals for all. For example, the world has achieved equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have achieved that target at all levels of education.”
Open mapping provides a two-fold benefit towards reaching the SDG for education: assisting partners, governments, and local communities understand gaps in services and distribution of educational facilities, as well as providing an opportunity for individuals in these groups to gain technical and vocational skills such as GIS and surveying.</description>

      <description>Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls “Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large.”
Open mapping projects can support gender equality by creating data about gendered problems that affect women and girls, and working to prioritize the involvement of all members of society in decision-making processes.</description>

      <description>Ensure access to water and sanitation for all “Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in and there is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. However, due to bad economics or poor infrastructure, millions of people including children die every year from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Water scarcity, poor water quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and educational opportunities for poor families across the world.</description>

      <description>Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all “Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. Transitioning the global economy towards clean and sustainable sources of energy is one of our greatest challenges in the coming decades. Sustainable energy is an opportunity – it transforms lives, economies and the planet.</description>

      <description>Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all “Roughly half the world’s population still lives on the equivalent of about US$2 a day. And in too many places, having a job doesn’t guarantee the ability to escape from poverty. This slow and uneven progress requires us to rethink and retool our economic and social policies aimed at eradicating poverty.”
By incorporating youth and other vulnerable populations, open mapping activities can provide vocational training in the latest open source GIS tools to substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education, or training and help achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people.</description>

      <description>Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, weather events are becoming more extreme and greenhouse gas emissions are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, the world’s average surface temperature is likely to surpass 3 degrees centigrade this century.</description>

      <description>Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources Our oceans — their temperature, circulation, chemistry, and ecosystems — play a fundamental role in making Earth habitable. Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. Throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital conduits for trade and transportation.</description>
