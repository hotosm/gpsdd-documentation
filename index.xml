      <description>PART II - Integrating and Implementing Open Mapping Efforts 1. Setting the Stage for Program Sustainability Maps have the power to tell stories about people and places and the ability to show patterns of ideas or issues through space and time. Citizen-generated data can leverage the local knowledge and expertise of individuals living in these communities to participate in addressing and identifying the societal issues being faced. Combining the power of maps and the value of community-led data collection enables a new way of understanding a group of people that a traditional approach to surveying, for example, may be unable to capture.</description>

      <description>2. Integrating workflow into existing projects Many organizations want to incorporate open mapping into their operations but don’t know where to start, believe that it requires rebuilding workflows from scratch, or that their operations will not be able to integrate open mapping. However, the open mapping workflow can be, and should be, integrated into existing workflows. The first step towards using open mapping is analyzing how existing projects and workflows can be altered and improved with integration.</description>

      <description>3. Designing an Open Mapping Project Designing and implementing an open mapping project can be complex, especially if there are ambitious mapping goals or a large group of partners involved. Several resources exist that provide further detail on navigating the mapping process:

      <description>4. Data Creation &amp;amp; Collection: Quick Start Guide Creating data for OpenStreetMap typically takes two forms: remote mapping and field data collection. Remote mapping is the process of tracing infrastructure such as buildings and roads into OpenStreetMap using aerial or satellite imagery. This process allows for volunteers and team members to create basemaps anywhere in the world with only a computer and internet connection.
Collecting data on the ground is an integral part of editing OSM.</description>

      <description>5. Quality control/assurance Quality Assurance and Quality Control is the process by which mappers, and OpenStreetMap contributors in general, check data to ensure that all information uploaded to OSM meets high standards for usage and to prevent vandalism. As OpenStreetMap is a free and open platform that anyone can use and edit, it is critical to the sustainability of open data and OSM that everyone participates in the quality assurance and quality control process – from field data collection to data cleaning to long-term maintenance of existing OSM data.</description>

      <description>6. Using Open Data &amp;amp; Maps for Analysis, Display and Decision-Making There are a handful of free tools available to extract and utilize OSM data for decision-making. By either using OSM data in conjunction with free population data sets from, for example, World Pop or other thematic datasets from the Humanitarian Data Exchange or even combining it with your own generated data, various tools can be used to clean, analyze and visualize information to inform project planning and decision-making.</description>

      <description>End poverty in all its forms everywhere “Extreme poverty rates have fallen by more than half since 1990. While this is a remarkable achievement, one-in-five people in developing regions still live on less than $1.90 a day. Millions more make little more than this daily amount and are at risk of slipping back into extreme poverty.”
Poverty elimination projects to map low income (often slum) areas can support humanitarian and development programming.</description>

      <description>Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, halt biodiversity loss “Forests cover 30 percent of the Earth’s surface and in addition to providing food security and shelter, forests are key to combating climate change, protecting biodiversity and the homes of the indigenous population. Thirteen million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6 billion hectares.</description>

      <description>Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages “Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers responsible for child and maternal mortality. Major progress has also been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation, reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio and the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, many more efforts are needed to control a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and emerging health issues.</description>

      <title>Goal 4 - Quality Education</title>

      <description>Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning “Basic literacy skills across the world have improved tremendously, yet bolder efforts are needed to achieve universal education goals for all. For example, the world has achieved equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have achieved that target at all levels of education.”
Open mapping provides a two-fold benefit towards reaching the SDG for education: assisting partners, governments, and local communities understand gaps in services and distribution of educational facilities, as well as providing an opportunity for individuals in these groups to gain technical and vocational skills such as GIS and surveying.</description>

      <title>Goal 5 - Gender Equality</title>
      <link>/pages/part-iv-using-open-data-and-maps-to-meet-and-monitor-sdgs/sdg-goal-5/</link>

      <guid>/pages/part-iv-using-open-data-and-maps-to-meet-and-monitor-sdgs/sdg-goal-5/</guid>
      <description>Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls “Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large.”
Open mapping projects can support gender equality by creating data about gendered problems that affect women and girls, and working to prioritize the involvement of all members of society in decision-making processes.</description>

      <guid>/pages/part-iv-using-open-data-and-maps-to-meet-and-monitor-sdgs/sdg-goal-7/</guid>
      <description>Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all “Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential. Transitioning the global economy towards clean and sustainable sources of energy is one of our greatest challenges in the coming decades. Sustainable energy is an opportunity – it transforms lives, economies and the planet.</description>
