## Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation

_"Investments in infrastructure – transport, irrigation, energy and information and communication technology – are crucial to achieving sustainable development and empowering communities in many countries. It has long been recognized that growth in productivity and incomes, and improvements in health and education outcomes require investment in infrastructure."_

Mapping basic infrastructure such as roads and buildings is often the first step in understanding and solving larger issues. Through the power of the HOT global community, roads and buildings can be mapped remotely while communities and teams on the ground add important information such building conditions and road surface quality. This information can be used to understand which populations have access to basic services and how to reach vulnerable people during a disaster. 

### What has been done? 

**[OSM Nicaragua](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/public_transportation_map_for_managua):** Community mappers in Nicaragua have a vision to create the most detailed and complete map of their country that empowers individuals to use open data and participatory technologies to solve common challenges. OSM Nicaragua-MapaNica.net’s aim is to continue mapping the public transit routes in Managua and surrounding cities, expecting to reach at least five new cities. They believe mapping is the first step towards improving the transportation system, while engaging new individuals in mapping. By engaging local stakeholders to use OSM for urban planning, the goal is to improve mobility and transport policies in the country. 

### What else can be done? 



*   Map roads in rural areas and monitor the development of road networks over time allows better estimates of the percentage of the population with nearby roads that are accessible year-round.
*   Increase access to ICT and the internet through provision of equipment, software, and training in the places that HOT works. 
*   Promote sustainable industrialisation
*   Access in rural areas
*   Understand development of road network over time
*   Increase access to ICT and internet
