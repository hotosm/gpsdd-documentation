## 6. Using Open Data & Maps for Analysis, Display and Decision-Making

There are a handful of free tools available to extract and utilize OSM data for decision-making. By either using OSM data in conjunction with free population data sets from, for example, World Pop or other thematic datasets from the Humanitarian Data Exchange or even combining it with your own generated data, various tools can be used to clean, analyze and visualize information to inform project planning and decision-making.
