## 5. Quality control/assurance

Quality Assurance and Quality Control is the process by which mappers, and OpenStreetMap contributors in general, check data to ensure that all information uploaded to OSM meets high standards for usage and to prevent vandalism. As OpenStreetMap is a free and open platform that anyone can use and edit, it is critical to the sustainability of open data and OSM that everyone participates in the quality assurance and quality control process – from field data collection to data cleaning to long-term maintenance of existing OSM data. 

The data quality dimensions identified through this framework as the highest priority for assessment of all datasets are: 



*   **Completeness**
*   **Consistency**
*   **Accuracy**
*   **Timeliness**
*   **Accessibility**

For each data quality phase, the following sets of questions should be answered: 

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Phase 1</strong>
<p>
<strong>Defining Needs & Requirements</strong>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Why are we collecting this data? Who will use it? 

<li>What data are we collecting? 

<li>What information will we and other users need to know about the data we collected?

<li>What is the geographic scope of our data?

<li>What is the temporal scope of our data collection? Does this timeline meet the needs of the users?

<li>What quality metrics are required for the datasets? Is there an allowable margin of error or acceptable data gaps?

<li>Have partners reviewed and agreed upon the needs and requirements of the project?

<li>Does the scope of this project fall under the OSM Organized Editing Guidelines? If so, does it meet the requirements? 
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Phase 2</strong>
<p>
<strong>Defining Data Collection Methodology</strong>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Have permissions been secured to conduct data collection in the area of interest? Has proper community outreach been conducted with the community and stakeholders relevant for the area of interest? 

<li>Have team members been provided specialized and hands-on training for their role?

<li>Has all software and hardware been selected based on the needs of the project? Has all software and hardware been tested? 

<li>Do data collection forms meet the need of the project and data model? Have data collection forms been trialed by surveyors and with survey subjects? 

<li>How will collected data be stored? What data protection strategies are in place?

<li>Where will the data come from and what standard indicators will be used that can help achieve objectives?
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Phase 3</strong>
<p>
<strong>Collecting Data & Producing Datasets</strong>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Are data collectors able to report issues and challenges in the field?  

<li>Is data quality being monitored during field data collection?

<li>Is field data being safely secured on a daily basis? 
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Phase 4</strong>
<p>
<strong>Cleaning and Validating Datasets</strong>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Has raw data been reviewed for errors prior to upload or packaging? What tools were used in this process and why? 

<li>Do the cleaned data sets include private data or publicly identifiable information? If so, has the dataset been split into public and private sets? 

<li>Has data been properly uploaded to OSM with designated changeset comments and tags?

<li>Has data uploaded to OSM been reviewed for additional quality assurance? What tools were used in this process and why?
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Phase 5</strong>
<p>
<strong>Ensuring Sustainability & Providing Documentation</strong>
   </td>
   <td>
<ul>

<li>Has data been made available through an open and accessible program?

<li>Has the availability of data been communicated to relevant stakeholders?

<li>Have the workflows, tools, and processes used for the project been documented? Is this documentation open and available for users outside of HOT?

<li>Have local stakeholders or other groups with potential for sustaining data use and data collection been trained in project methodology?
</li>

### 5.1 Overview of Tools used in QC/QA

While quality assurance can be and should be performed at all stages of a mapping campaign, several tools exist to assist with quality assurance during the data cleaning and upload process as well as monitoring data after uploading. 

The following are Quality Assurance tools commonly used in the HOT workflow. A detailed overview of these and other QA tools can be found at the [Quality Assurance Tools Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Quality_assurance). Different tools check for different errors and issues. If you want to:



*   Check for attribute completeness, use MapCampaigner.
*   Check for potential vandalism, use OSMCha.
*   Check for contributions and upload issues by individual user, use OSMCha.
*   Check for tagging issues, use Osmose AND JOSM Validation.
*   Check for geometry issues, use Osmose AND JOSM Validation.

**MapCampaigner**

[MapCampaigner](http://campaigns.hotosm.org/) is a tool developed by HOT to monitor attribute completeness for predefined areas of interest (AOI). Based on your data model, the tool checks and highlights any map features that are missing pre-defined tags within your AOI, and allows team validators to download and fix those features.

**OSMCha**

[OSMCha](https://osmcha.mapbox.com/), or the OpenStreetMap Changeset Analyzer, is a tool designed to review uploads and changes to OSM data, largely to prevent vandalism and bad edits made to map data. This tool allows users to filter by username, location, dates of upload, and other metadata features. OSMCha is useful for monitoring the progress of data cleaning and upload teams. 

**Osmose**

[Osmose](http://osmose.openstreetmap.fr) is a tool that monitors multiple quality control issues in OSM. These include issues with feature geometry (such as overlapping buildings/nodes, incomplete features, and duplications), and also common tagging issues (such as missing, unsuitable or poorly formatted tags). More information about Osmose can be found at the [Osmose OSM Wiki Page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmose).

**JOSM Tools**

There are tools built into JOSM, as well as additional plugins that can assist with data quality control during the upload process.



*   **Filters** is a built-in tool that allows you to disable, hide, select, and highlight specific groups of objects based on flexible custom parameters. This tool will help you to spot and avoid common mistakes, and review data.
*   The **Validation Tool** is another built-in tool that will review and search for common errors as well as provide warnings about potentially problematic data.
*   The **Todo List plug-in** allows users to systematically review data that is to be uploaded, and monitor progress of data cleaning work. The “ToDo List” plug-in, needs to be downloaded before it can be used. Visit this page to learn how to install plug-ins in JOSM, then download the “ToDo List” plug-in.
